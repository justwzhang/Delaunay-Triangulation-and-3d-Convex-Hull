# Optimal Transportation Homework

This C++ project creates a 3d convex hull of any set of points and can also create both a delaunay triangulation and voronoi diagram given any set of 2d points.

## System

The code has been tested on Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04 and MacOS 10.15.5, if there is any problem, please let me know.

## Directory Structure

``` txt
convex_hull       -- Folder for 3D convex hull algorithm.
